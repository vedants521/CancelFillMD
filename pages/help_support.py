        ### Welcome to CancelFillMD Pro!
        
        CancelFillMD Pro helps you automatically fill cancelled appointments by matching them 
        with waitlisted patients. Here's how it works:
        
        1. **Patients join waitlists** for their preferred dates and specialties
        2. **When appointments are cancelled**, the system automatically identifies matching patients
        3. **Notifications are sent** via SMS and email with secure booking links
        4. **First patient to respond** gets the appointment
        5. **Staff is notified** when slots are filled
        
        ### Key Benefits:
        - üìà Recover 80%+ of lost revenue from cancellations
        - ‚è±Ô∏è Fill slots in under 30 minutes instead of hours
        - üíº Save 2+ hours of staff time per cancellation
        - üòä Improve patient satisfaction with faster appointments

        ### Adding Patients to Waitlist
        
        **Option 1: Patient Self-Service**
        1. Direct patients to the **Join Waitlist** page
        2. They enter their information and preferences
        3. System automatically adds them to appropriate waitlists

        - Encourage specific date preferences for better matching
        - Monitor waitlist size - aim for 10-15 patients per specialty
